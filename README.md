# Excel Data into PPTX 
A Python Project to convert data from excel into a PowerPoint report  

#About 

During my internship at State Street, as a data analyst, I was able to implement a system to turn our project managerâ€™s data/schedule on Excel into a PowerPoint report. This PowerPoint was a progress report for the entire team to see the schedule of each project and their respective detail. Before I created this program project managers were required to dedicated 2-3 hours during thier work week to fix it. While I am not able to show the project that I worked on during my internship, I instead spent some time over winter break to showcase what I did during my time in the summer. Furthermore, instead of a PowerPoint on project management I decided to make it about the National Parks.
