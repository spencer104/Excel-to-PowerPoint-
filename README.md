# Excel---PPTX-
Python Project to convert data from excel to powerpoint 

During my internship at State Street as a data analyst I was able to implement a system to turn our project manager’s data/schedule on excel into a PowerPoint. This PowerPoint creates a progress report for the entire team to see the schedule of each project and their respective details. While I am not able to show the project that I worked on during my internship, I created a small project to show a little bit what I did during my internship. Instead of making a PowerPoint on project management I decided to do it on our country’s greatest gem, the National Parks.
